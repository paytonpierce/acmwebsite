            "ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and
            professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the
            field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM
            strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong
            leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of
            technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its
            members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career
            development, and professional networking. <br />
            <br />
            Founded at the dawn of the computer age, ACM’s reach extends to
            every part of the globe, with more than half of its 100,000 members
            residing outside the U.S. Its growing membership has led to Councils
            in Europe, India, and China, fostering networking opportunities that
            strengthen ties within and across countries and technical
            communities. Their actions enhance ACM’s ability to raise awareness
            of computing’s important technical, educational, and social issues
            around the world."
