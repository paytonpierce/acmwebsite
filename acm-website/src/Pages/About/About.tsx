        Participation in all these chapters provides a unique combination of social interaction and professional 
        dialogue among peers in their respective geographic areas. ACM Chapter members reflect all facets of computing 
        from academia, research, business, and industry. Because of their subject‚Äêspecific nature, chapters typically 
        focus on information and insight not easily found elsewhere.
